So no binaries nor public project for this.  Its just too many messes of the same thing I couldn’t find the parts and sort of gave up entirely on this guy — though it <strong>WAS</strong> my proof of a working prototype at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/prj/ds/dssx0.png\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"/images/prj/ds/dssx1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"first-vst-prototype\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#first-vst-prototype\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>First VST Prototype</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/images/prj/arp/20170421_2251cst.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>First keeping it simple, tested playing around with the <a href=\"https://www.cockos.com/wdl/\" title=\"Cookos WDL/iPlug\r\nwww.cockos.com/wdl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">iplug</a> right about the time <a href=\"https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol\" title=\"https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol\r\nEnhanced version of Cockos&#x27; iPlug - A simple-to-use C++ framework for developing cross platform audio plugins and targeting multiple plugin APIs with the same code.
